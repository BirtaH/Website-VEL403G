                                    The project was two part, one was to design a object that could not be manufactured by subtraction and to 3d print this object. The material provided in the course is a maximum of 100g. As well as that I had to 3d scan an object of my choosing and document the process. Description of this part can be found her below. The second part is a group project and the goal was to test the limits of the 3d printer and make rules regarding its use, this part can be accessed <a href="Hópverkefni 2 (elisaosk.github.io)">here</a>.

                                    For this project I decided to use Fusion 360, Cura and experimented with Meshmixer. I have previous experience with Fusion as well as Inventor, Autocad and Solidworks. I decided to use Fusion because in project 1 in this course I used Fusion and that went great.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Fusion 360 is a cloud-based CAD/CAM tool for collaborative product development. Fusion 360 enables exploration and iteration on product ideas and collaboration within distributed product development team.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Cura is an open source slicing application for 3D printers. I chose this program because my brother recommended it. He has previous experience with 3d printing.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Meshmixer is a state-of-the-art software for working with triangle meshes. I used Meshmixer when i attempted to create an irregular pattern in my design. In the end I went another way but this program has many excellent features to create patterns.

									<h3>Design</h3>
								</header>
                                <p>
                                    I started by looking at projects from students that have finished this course as well as looking up things to 3d print online. In the end I decided to design and manufacture a small pencil case for my favourite pens. I have a large one that is always stuffed and sometimes I can’t find my favourite pen quickly. This will hopefully encourage me to stop hoarding pens. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I looked for some ideas for the design online and decided to create a simple case with a pattern. I found the video <a href=" Layer by Layer - How To Make Voronoi Patterns in MeshMixer - YouTube "> Layer by Layer - How To Make Voronoi Patterns in Meshmixer </a> that shows how to use Meshmixer to create patterns on an object. I thought the pattern looked very nice and decided to use Meshmixer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now that I had a design in mind I had choose the size of the pensil case. I chose the radius of the bottom, wall height and thickness. Later I changed these parameters because of how long this would take to print. The original parameters can be seen in the picture here below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_parameters1.jpg"> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    By drawing half of the vase and using the command Revolve I created the shape of the vase. The drawing can be seen here below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_sketch.jpg" width = 400> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And then after using Revolve:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_revolve.jpg" width = 500> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The command Shell is used to hollow out the shape. I chose to have the wall thickness 3mm. To round out the edges of the pencil holder the command Fillet was used. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_extrude.jpg" width = 500> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To create the pattern in Meshmixer I exported the pencil holder in stl format and opened the file in Meshmixer. I made a couple of different versions of the pencil holder with different patterns, but I was never happy with the result. One example can be seen here below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_meshmixer.jpg" width = 500> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    So I decided to make the pattern in Fusion and not irregular. I drew the pattern on the front plane.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_mynstur_sketch.jpg" width = 500> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then the command Extrude is used to cut from the pencil holder. These holes are then replicated around the middle axis using Circular pattern.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_mynstur.jpg" width = 500>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was very happy with this result and exported the file in stl format. This file can be opened in Cura and I chose the printer Ultimaker 3. This is the printer I will be using at Fablab. After slicing the object Cura showed that printing this object would take 8 hours and 16 minutes. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_cura.jpg" width="500"> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Because of this I decided to change the radius of the bottom and the wall height. The new parameters can be seen here below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_parameters.jpg" width="800"> 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I also changed the shape of the curve and the new drawing can be seen here below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_vasi_sketch1.jpg" width="500">
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The final design is:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_loka.jpg" width="500">

                                <p>
                                    Then the file is exported and opened in Cura. The printing will take 5 hours and 2 minutes
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I was using a 3d printer called Ultimaker 3. To start printing the pencil holder I opened the file in Cura and plugged a USB drive from the 3d printer in my computer. The option to move files to the USB drive appears and that is what I do. When the USB drive is plugged into the 3d printer you can choose to print the latest file by simply pressing enter.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The printer takes a couple of minutes to warm up and then starts printing.
                                </p>
                                <p>

									<h3>Result</h3>

                                <p>
                                    I was very happy with the result. Although the pencil holder was smaller than I thought it would be. But I think that is mostly because it looks a lot bigger in Fusion. But the size was suitable for its purpose.

                                    I started by researching what kind of a object is hard to 3d scan so I could choose a object that would give a nice result. In the end I decided to use a bird statue I have at home. The statue is small matte and has small details on it.

                                    Next I created a dense point cloud. When asked to choose the reconstruction type and desired preset for the dense point cloude creational presets I chose catagory close range and preset high details. For the surface reconstruction presets I chose catagory close range and preset high details.

                                    The result is:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    I decided to remove the table around the bird. Using the editing window on the left side.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <img src="images/v3_fugl3DF2.jpg" width="500">

                                <p>
                                    I was quiet happy with the result, but due to the 50 picture minimum in 3DF zephyr I could not add any more pictures and therefore not add missing details.
